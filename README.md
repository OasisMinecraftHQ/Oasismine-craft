- Every action instantly affects the surrounding environment
- Completely based on frame-by-frame simulation system

### Game Modes
Multiple environment options available:
- Village Outpost
- Dense Forest
- Rugged Coastline
- Desert Expanse
- Mountain Meadow

### Game Characteristics
1. **Time Limit**:
   - 5 minutes per session
   - Can refresh to start a new session

2. **Unique Game Mechanics**:
   - Hotbar items change automatically
   - Environment transforms with perspective changes
   - Supports basic Minecraft operations (mining, placing, moving)

## Technical Features

### AI Implementation
- Utilizes neural network technology
- Trained on existing Minecraft gameplay footage
- Real-time frame iteration generation

### Limitations
- No object permanence
- Constantly changing environments
- Unstable inventory contents
- Unexpected scene transitions may occur

## Usage Guidelines

### Basic Controls
- Use WASD keys for movement
- Mouse controls view
- Left-click for interaction (mining, etc.)
- Right-click to place or use items

### Gameplay Tips
1. Rotate view to change scenery if unsatisfied with current environment
2. Pay attention to hotbar changes
3. Try interacting with different environments
4. Take short breaks to avoid visual fatigue

## Safety Notice

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**:
- Play in moderation
- Take regular breaks from the screen
- Maintain connection with the real world
- Stop immediately if experiencing dizziness

## Technical Outlook

This project represents a significant milestone in combining game development with AI technology:
- Demonstrates AI potential in game generation
- Paves the way for more complex AI-driven games
- Pioneers new directions in real-time AI content generation

## Community Discussion

The project has sparked widespread discussion about:
- AI's role in game development
- Balance between creative freedom and technological advancement
- Innovation vs. tradition in gaming experiences

2. Select your preferred environment
3. Wait for your turn if there's a queue
4. Explore and interact with the AI-generated world

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Optimal Settings**:
   - Use a full-screen browser window
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Take breaks between sessions

2. **Known Behaviors**:
   - Items in hotbar will change randomly
   - Environments transform unexpectedly
   - Player skin may switch between Steve and Alex

3. **Troubleshooting**:
   - Refresh page if stuck
   - Clear browser cache if experiencing issues
   - Check internet connection if loading slowly

## Conclusion

Oasis Minecraft represents an experimental leap into AI-generated gaming environments. While it may not replicate the full Minecraft experience, it serves as a fascinating demonstration of AI's potential in interactive digital environments.
